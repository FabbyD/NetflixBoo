# Priority
o Fix seek listener to listen even if mouse is not over scrubber bar
o Fix seek listener when seeking while the video is playing (currently thinks the video is paused)
o Maybe use play-pause button as indicator of the video state instead 
o OR keep my own variable to do that... Less safe
o Fix reset when user leaves title page (i.e. goes back to browse)

# Optional
o Change icon to heart
o Empty heart when off
o Full heart when on
o Check server to see if user is already connected
o Test the response time to do: Netflix->background->server->background->Netflix
o Refactor VideoController.playButtonHandler and scrubberHandler into one function
o Add listener to child_removed when sessions are removed to update the sessions list
